# RemoveGap
**A mod that removes the gap in the Affluent bakery/Mass producer icon.**

Ever since I first played Cookie Clicker the strange gap in the icon has bugged me.
In the older version of the icon, it's easier to see that it's because there's less cookies than the higher achievements. But with the added border, it just looks like a big hole in the achievement.
Thankfully, it's a very easy thing to fix.
